# Hazard

A game where each round the goal of players is to reach a region on the opposite end of the level that they build.
Rounds are split into a build phase and a run phase. In the build phase players build more onto the level they must compete in.
In the run phase the players are spawned on top of the start platform and must reach the goal region within the time limit.
