To open a teleport menu, right-click while holding the book titled "Park Directory".

The park is filled with cakes that reward coins, some are behind challenges, while secret cakes are often hidden around landmarks or behing puzzles. You can use "/cake list" to track your progress.

When you get 75% or more of the challenge or secret cakes, you get a special trophy next to your name in chat.

A few park activitiess offer chat badge trophies, including parkour completion percentages, secret cake discovery percentages, FrogWare, Snake, and CubeClimber.

You can use "/warp" to teleport directly to activities for which you know the name. (eg. "/warp showdown")

Coin rewards can be redeemed in survival at "/warp coinshop", where park staff have generously donated items.

Some donors can launch random fireworks in the park.

Your inventory here is separate from your survival inventory.

At any time you can type "/survival" to go back to where you were last in the survival worlds.

If anything breaks in the park, you can contact park staff (orange names), server staff (blue names), or directly to PseudoKnight with "/msg PseudoKnight halp, it borked, and here's how...". Details can help us track down the problem.
