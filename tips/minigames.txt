Right-click while holding the book titled "Park Directory" to get a navigable menu.

The park is filled with cakes that reward coins, some are challenges, while secret cakes are often hidden around landmarks or puzzles. Use "/cake list" to track your progress.

When you get more than half of the cakes in a category, you get a special trophy next to your name in chat showing your progress.

A few park activities offer chat badge trophies, including parkour completion percentages, secret cake discovery percentages, FrogWare, Snake, and CubeClimber.

You can use "/warp" to teleport directly to activities for which you know the name. (eg. "/warp showdown")

Coin rewards can be redeemed in survival at "/warp coinshop", where park staff have generously donated items.

Some donors can launch random fireworks in the park. Don't panic.

Your inventory here is separate from your survival inventory.

At any time you can type "/survival" to go back to where you were last in the survival worlds, including the outworld. The reverse is possible with "/park".

If anything breaks in the park, contact park staff (orange names) or directly to PseudoKnight with "/msg PseudoKnight halp..." with details to help us track down the problem.

Use "/marathon" to have a race against other players across several parkour courses.
