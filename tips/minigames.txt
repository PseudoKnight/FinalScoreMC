The park is filled with secret cakes, often hidden around landmarks or puzzles. Use "/cake list" to track your progress.

When you get more than half of the cakes in a category, you get a special trophy next to your name in chat showing your progress.

A few park activities offer chat badge trophies, including parkour completion percentages, secret cake discovery percentages, FrogWare, Snake, and CubeClimber.

You can use "/warp" to teleport directly to activities for which you know the name. (eg. "/warp showdown")

Some server contributors can launch random fireworks in the park.

Your inventory here in the Park is separate from your survival inventory.

At any time you can type "/survival" to go back to where you were last in the survival worlds, including the outworld. The reverse is possible with "/park".

If anything breaks in the park, send an offline message to PseudoKnight with "/msg PseudoKnight halp..." with details to help us track down the problem.

Use "/marathon" to have a race against other players across several parkour courses.
