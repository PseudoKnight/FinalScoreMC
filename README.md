These are CommandHelper scripts, adding a variety of functionality, much of which is very specific to our server. For expediancy I hard-coded some things into the scripts, but some of it is flexible enough to be used elsewhere, especially if you make some minor modifications. Like some scripts have a basic world check for 'custom', which is our mini-game world.
