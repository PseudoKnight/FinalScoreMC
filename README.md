This repository consists of scripts for the FinalScore Minecraft server using the CommandHelper plugin. It contains extensive custom functionality and games. If you want to use any of this on your server, you're free to do so. However, each script should be evaluated for dependencies, like CommandHelper extensions, auto_includes, and other server-specific configurations. Not all scripts have this documentation, but I try to make sure [minigames](minigames/README.md) does.

Visit http://methodscript.com for details on CommandHelper itself and the MethodScript language.
