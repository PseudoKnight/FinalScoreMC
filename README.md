# FinalScoreMC Scripts

This repository consists of scripts for the FinalScoreMC Minecraft server in the MethodScript language using the CommandHelper plugin. It contains extensive custom functionality and games. If you want to use any of this on your server, you're free to do so. However, each script should be evaluated for dependencies, like CommandHelper extensions, auto included procedures, and possibly other server-specific configurations. Some scripts will have this documented in the top file options.

Visit the [methodscript.com](https://methodscript.com) site or the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/EngineHub/CommandHelper) for details on CommandHelper itself and the MethodScript language.
