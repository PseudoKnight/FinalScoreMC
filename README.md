# FinalScoreMC Scripts

This repository consists of scripts for the FinalScoreMC Minecraft server in the MethodScript language using the CommandHelper plugin. It contains extensive custom functionality and games. You are free to use any of this on your server as all code here is under the MIT license. However, each script should be evaluated for dependencies, like CommandHelper extensions, auto included procedures, and possibly other server-specific configurations. Some scripts will have this documented in the file options at the top or in the directory README. Most of these scripts are not designed with portability in mind.

Visit the [methodscript.com](https://methodscript.com) site or the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/EngineHub/CommandHelper) for details on CommandHelper itself and the MethodScript language.
